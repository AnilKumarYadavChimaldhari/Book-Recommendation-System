# Book Recommendation System 
Part I of the project for E4571 Personalization: Theory & Application.  
Team members: Deepak Maran, Kewei Liu, Rakshita, Xiaohui Guo  

One Paragraph of project description goes here.  
Treat this as a case study and think about it from a business perspective. What is your objective? What are you trying to optimizing and what are you willing to sacrifice?  

## Project Abstract
How well was this envisioned as an actual business problem? Is it clear what is being solved, and what acceptance criteria would be?

## The main contents of this project are following:
- Data Cleaning 
- Data Sampling
- Implementation of Two Collaborative Filtering Models
- Evaluation
- Exploration on Hyperparameters
- Exploration on Sample Sizes
- Conclusion
- A Further Discussion

## Algorithms to be implemented:
- K-Nearest Neighbor model:   
  user-based  
  item based
- Latent Factor Model:  
  SVD-MF  
  GD-MF?  
 Â NMF  

## Datasets
- XXX Data accessed from (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon-links.html)
- Number of users : 
- Number of books : 
- Number of ratings : 

## Tools
- Python 2  

## Building Recommendation Systems  
### 1. Data Cleaning  

### 2. Data Sampling  

example:  
1. Download data  
You need to have 'data' directory in your HOME.  

```bash
chmod +x download.sh; ./download.sh 
```
